"""The four seats as LangGraph nodes: Architect, Planner, Researcher, Builder.

- Architect: no tools. Sets the direction, then holds the approval gate.
- Planner: no tools. Turns the goal into steps and picks the next seat.
- Researcher: the node runs the read-only GraphRAG tools and hands the seat
  what they returned.
- Builder: filesystem, git, terminal and test tools, and nothing else.

No node takes a seat's account of its own work on trust: verdicts, plans and
research are parsed from fixed sections, and what the Builder wrote is linted
and run before anyone rules on it.
