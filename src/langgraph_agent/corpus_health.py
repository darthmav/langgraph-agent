"""Is the corpus still the archive? The comparison nothing else makes.

A corpus that has drifted from the files it is built from has no symptom of
its own: every counter stays non-zero and consistent while retrieval answers
from what the archive used to hold. This compares the two:

* `missing` -- in the walk, not in the corpus: written since the last rebuild.
* `extra` -- in the corpus, not in the walk: deleted, renamed or no longer
  walked, and still answering searches.
* `oversized` -- in the walk, too large to index, so correctly absent. Kept
  apart from `missing` because a rebuild cannot change it.
* `unreadable` -- in the walk, but not UTF-8 text, which the indexer skips;
  kept apart for the same reason.
