"""Online research: the web half of the corpus.

Nothing in this process could open a socket before this module. The corpus was
a function of what sat on disk in the checkout, so a run could only ever be as
informed as the checkout was: a goal naming a library this project has never
vendored had no source of truth to retrieve, retrieval came back under
`RETRIEVAL_RELEVANCE_FLOOR`, and the Researcher's seat answered from whatever
the model happened to remember. That is the one path where the seat's model is
the variable, and it is the path a goal about anything external always took.

What this adds is a **pre-run** phase, and the ordering is the design rather
than a convenience. Documents are searched, written under `WEB_RESEARCH_DIR`
and embedded *before* the graph starts streaming, for two reasons that are both
rules written elsewhere in this package:

* `_refuse_while_a_run_is_in_flight` (serve.py) refuses every corpus write
  while a run is live, because a corpus changing underneath the Researcher
  manufactures an absence no seat can detect -- a rebuild half-done returns
  whatever fraction of itself has been re-added, which reads as
  `no_relevant_knowledge` and routes the run around a gap that was created out
  from under it. Embedding before the Architect's opening pass is not a way
  around that guard. It is the only ordering that respects it.
* A document embedded but never written to disk survives exactly until the next
  reindex, which then deletes it *silently*, in a pass reporting success and a
  file count that looks right. So the file is written first and embedded
  second -- the same ordering, for the same reason, as
  `store_uploaded_document` -- and `WEB_RESEARCH_DIR` has to stay inside
  `PROJECT_INDEX_PATTERNS` and out of `PROJECT_INDEX_EXCLUDES`.

**Nothing here costs money and nothing here needs an account.** The result list
comes from DuckDuckGo's keyless HTML endpoint, or from a SearxNG instance the
operator hosts. That is the only part of the pipeline that cannot be built
here -- a web index is not something a project makes for itself -- and it is
deliberately the *only* thing taken from outside. Ranking, extraction and
selection are all ours.

The pipeline has four stages, and the last two are the reason it is ours:

1. **Fan out.** One search on a raw goal asks a search engine to be good at a
   sentence. `expand_queries` derives several from the goal using this
   project's own `tokenize` -- the identifier-aware one, so a goal naming
   `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` also searches `builder deadline seconds`.
2. **Fuse the rankings.** Each query returns its own ordering, merged with
   `reciprocal_rank_fusion` -- the same function `search` uses to merge the
   dense and lexical halves. A page several queries agree on outranks one that
   won a single query, which is what makes the fan-out worth doing rather than
   just three times the fetching.
3. **Extract with our own reader** (`html_text`), which reports how much of
   each page it kept and whether it had to fall back, so a thin page is a
   reading rather than a mystery.
4. **Gate on our own score.** The engine's rank decides what is *fetched*; it
   does not decide what is *embedded*. Every extracted page is scored with
   `BM25Index` against the goal, and a page that cannot clear the bar is
   thrown away unread. This is the answer to the problem this phase would
   otherwise create: web documents compete with the checkout's own files at
   retrieval time, under a relevance floor calibrated on a corpus containing
   none of them, so the cheapest protection is not letting a page in unless it
   is about the goal by the same measure that will later retrieve it.

The gate is a **ratio of the best page's score, never an absolute number**.
That is not a preference; `lexical.py` records the reason. A BM25 score is
unbounded and corpus-relative, so a constant threshold is a hyperparameter
tuned on one set of pages and wrong on the next -- the same objection that
stopped `search` from fusing dense and lexical scores by weighted sum.

    Takes a *factory* rather than a corpus, and calls it only once a page has
    earned a place. The caller passes the creating door (`_kb_for_indexing`),
    which is right -- storing a page is indexing, and a goal researched against
    a machine with no corpus should leave one behind holding what it found.
    Resolving that door on the way in instead left one behind holding
    **nothing**: the phase is switched off in every test and on any machine
    without `WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED`, and a phase that never ran still built an
    empty store, which then reported itself as a knowledge base to everything
    that looked afterwards. `rag_stats` read `empty` where the truth was
    `absent`, and those two call for different things from the operator -- only
    one of them means "press Reindex". The same held for a goal the web has
    nothing to say about: twelve pages considered, none kept, a corpus created
    to hold them.

    Returns a report rather than raising, and the report distinguishes a phase
    that found nothing from one that never ran and one that broke -- see
    `search_web`. A per-document failure is collected into `failed` and does
    not abandon the rest: one page that came back empty should cost that page,
    not the other seven.

    `considered` and `documents` are both reported because they answer
    different questions: how much was read, and how much was good enough to
    keep. A phase that fetched twelve pages and embedded none is working
    correctly on a goal the web has nothing to say about, and it must not look
    like a phase that failed.
