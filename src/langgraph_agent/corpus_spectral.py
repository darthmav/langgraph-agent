"""Whole-graph spectral analysis of the corpus.

Four questions about the shape of the knowledge graph, kept apart from the
store that holds it. `GraphRAGKnowledgeBase` mixes this in, so every caller
still writes `kb.topics()` and `stats()` still reaches `self.connectivity()`;
nothing about the API moved.

They live here because of a limit they were quietly breaking.
`MAX_INDEXABLE_BYTES` is 100,000 characters and `graphrag_server` had grown to
100,132 -- so the module defining the corpus was being **skipped by every
reindex**, silently, and could not be retrieved by the Researcher that reads
this project's own code. It crossed the line twice in one afternoon, once from
adding the staleness check and once from two one-line guards, which is what
makes it structural rather than incidental: any edit to that file was a coin
toss. These four methods are 29.5 KB of it and are a genuinely separate
concern -- the store answers "what is in the corpus", these answer "what shape
is it" -- so moving them buys ~30 KB of headroom and a better seam at the same
time.

Each of the four is documented at its own docstring. What they share is a
refusal to report a finding they cannot support: `topics` returns
`no_clear_structure` rather than invent a `k`, `bottleneck` has a
`certified_none` verdict backed by Cheeger's lower bound and an `inconclusive`
one for the gap between that bound and the sweep, `connectivity` reports
`lambda_2` as `None` rather than 0.0 when there is nothing to measure, and
`duplicate_entities` only ever proposes. The measurements behind each of those
choices are in CLAUDE.md.

        A reindex that silently drops edges -- an entity-extraction regression
        in `add_document`, say -- does not change the document count and does
        not raise. It shows up here first, as a rising component count or a
        collapsing `lambda_2`, long before it shows up as worse search.

        **Components come from networkx, not from the spectrum.** The textbook
        identity is that the multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 equals the number of
        connected components, and `reports/spectral_applicability.md` proposes
        counting near-zero eigenvalues for exactly that reason. Two measured
        objections, both on this project's own graph shape (920 nodes):

        1. It is 42x the cost of the linear-time answer -- 32ms of
           eigendecomposition against 0.76ms of `number_connected_components`
           -- for a number networkx already computes exactly.
        2. On the *normalized* Laplacian it is simply wrong. The identity holds
           for `L = D - A`; for `I - D^-1/2 A D^-1/2` an isolated node has
           `D^-1/2 = 0`, so the `I` term leaves a bare 1 on its diagonal and it
           contributes eigenvalue **1, not 0**. This graph has 29 isolated
           nodes out of 30 components, so the spectral count returns 1 where
           the truth is 30.

        **lambda_2 is measured on the largest component, and normalized.** Two
        deliberate choices:

        - On the whole graph lambda_2 is identically 0 whenever the corpus is
          disconnected, and it is -- 30 components in the shape measured here.
          A health signal that reads 0.0 every time is not a signal. The
          largest component's lambda_2 is the number that actually moves when
          the body of the corpus knits together or comes apart.
        - Normalized, so it lands in [0, 2] and does not scale with degree.
          The unnormalized lambda_2 grows as documents mention more entities,
          which makes this reindex's value incomparable with last week's --
          and comparing across reindexes is the entire purpose.

        Returns `lambda_2: None` rather than a number when the largest
        component has fewer than two nodes: lambda_2 is undefined there, and 0.0
        would read as "totally disconnected" rather than "nothing to measure".

        The A2 application from `reports/spectral_applicability.md`:
        Ng-Jordan-Weiss spectral clustering over the normalized Laplacian,
        which on a bipartite document/entity graph puts documents together with
        the entities that define them -- so each cluster reads as a topic
        rather than as a list of ids. `neighborhood()` shows one node's
        surroundings; this is the whole-corpus map that degree-filtered sweeps
        cannot produce.

        **The number of clusters is where this application was weakest, and it
        is not wired straight to the eigengap.** The report proposes choosing
        `k` from the eigengap; `reports/spectral_architecture_benchmark.md`
        measured that heuristic getting `k` wrong on 3 of 8 architectures,
        including k = 10 for a barbell whose answer is 2. The heuristic always
        returns *some* k, so on a corpus with no topic structure it invents
        one, and clusters presented without that caveat are a fabricated map.

        What makes it usable is that the failures are not merely wrong, they
        are *undecided*: the winning gap barely beats the runner-up. Measured
        across 18 corpora with a planted topic count the eigengap was correct
        every time at a decisiveness of 5.1-23.4, while a grid, a small-world
        ring, an expander and a single dense topic all landed at 1.0-1.8. Below
        `EIGENGAP_DECISIVENESS` the verdict is `no_clear_structure` and no
        clusters are returned, because a map of a corpus that has no topics is
        worse than no map.

        An explicit `k` skips that gate -- a caller asking for six clusters has
        made the decision -- but the decisiveness is still reported, so the
        answer never hides how much the corpus agreed with it.

        Every cluster carries its own conductance, which is the second and
        independent check: a cluster that is genuinely a community has a low
        one, and a `k` that split a real community in half shows up as several
        clusters with high conductance even when the eigengap looked decisive.
        The two signals catch different failures and neither replaces the other.

        Runs on the largest connected component, for the reason
        `connectivity()` and `bottleneck()` do: components are already clusters,
        so on a disconnected graph the eigenvectors would spend themselves
        rediscovering the orphans `connectivity()` already counted.

        - `inconclusive` -- the bound permits a bottleneck and the sweep cut did
          not find one. Cheeger brackets the true conductance between
          `mu_2 / 2` and `sqrt(2 * mu_2)`, and that bracket is wide (measured
          from 4x to 546x across graph shapes in
          `reports/spectral_architecture_benchmark.md`), so the sweep cut
          genuinely can miss. Saying so is the honest answer; collapsing it
          into "no bottleneck" would report a gap in the evidence as a finding.

        Runs on the largest connected component, for the same reason
        `connectivity()` measures `lambda_2` there: on a disconnected graph the
        Fiedler vector is a component indicator, so the sweep cut returns one
        component against the rest at conductance 0. That is a true answer to a
        question nobody asked -- "your corpus has an orphan" is what
        `connectivity()` is for, and it would crowd out the real bridge every
        time.

        """Entities that are two spellings of one name, as merge candidates.

        `add_document` mints an entity per capitalised token, so the same thing
        arrives under several names: `Builder` and `BUILDER` from a heading,
        `Entity` and `Entities` from a plural, `Builder` and `Builders`. This
        proposes those pairs and reports the structural evidence for each. It
        never merges -- which entities mean the same thing is a decision about
        meaning that the graph cannot make.

        **This used to rank candidates by distance in a spectral embedding, and
        the measurement retired that outright.** On this project's own corpus
        it produced 33,060 candidates of which **67% sat at distance exactly
        0.0000 with a neighbourhood overlap of 1.00** -- the docstring's own
        "strongest merge evidence there is" -- and the top of the list read
        `['LEGAL', 'Virginia']`, `['Canada', 'Professional']`,
        `['Consequences', 'PIPEDA']`. Those are pendant collisions: two
        entities each mentioned by exactly one document, the same one, are
        structurally identical by construction, and 60% of this corpus's
        entities have degree 1. Meanwhile the true duplicates -- `Builder` /
        `Builders`, `Entity` / `Entities`, and all thirty case variants --
        were **not candidates at any rank**. Graded against ground truth the
        spectral ranking scored 0% precision and 0% recall; so did Jaccard, and
        so did containment used as a ranker. Name similarity scored 100%
        precision on its top 20.

        Two things went wrong and only one of them is the pendants.

        *A real duplicate is asymmetric.* `Builder` is mentioned by 29
        documents and `Builders` by 4. That is a subset, not a match, and both
        the embedding distance and the Jaccard overlap are built on symmetry --
        they score the pair 0.14 and rank it below thousands of unrelated ones.
        Containment (`shared / min(degree)`) reads 1.00 on the same pair, and
        is what the evidence here is measured with.

        *And structure cannot generate candidates on a real corpus at all.*
        Tightening it does not help: at Jaccard 1.00 with at least three shared
        documents, the survivors on this corpus are `Oppenheim` / `Schafer`
        (two authors cited in the same three papers), `Nyquist` / `Frequency`,
        and `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` / `NODE_DEADLINE_SECONDS`. Every one is
        co-occurrence, not duplication. The synthetic corpus that once
        justified the structural signal assigned entities to documents **at
        random**, which makes an identical neighbourhood astronomically
        improbable and therefore strong evidence. Real corpora are the opposite:
        entities belonging to one topic are mentioned in the same documents --
        that is what a topic *is* -- so identical neighbourhoods are ordinary
        and mean "discussed together". The property the structural test depended
        on is precisely the property a real corpus does not have.

        So names generate the candidates and structure is the evidence, which
        inverts the old docstring's "structure beats names here and names
        actively mislead". That claim was true of the fixture and false of the
        corpus.

        **What this gives up, explicitly: two names for one thing that share no
        characters.** `LanguageModel` for an entity already called something
        else is not found and cannot be, and nothing here should be read as
        looking for it. That case is not merely unimplemented -- it was
        measured, and on real data every method that reaches for it returns
        collocations instead. Anyone reinstating a structural generator should
        re-run that measurement first.

        Pairs come in two kinds, and the difference is how much they need to
        prove. `case` -- the two names are the same token bar capitalisation --
        is certain on the name alone and carries no structural requirement,
        which matters because these are the most asymmetric pairs in the corpus
        (`BUILDER` appears in one document, `Builder` in 29) and any evidence
        floor would drop every one of them. `lexical` is a likeness rather than
        a certainty, so it must also clear `DUPLICATE_CONTAINMENT`; that is
        what separates `Builder` / `Builders` from two merely similar names for
        different things.
