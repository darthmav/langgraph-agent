    together want roughly 10 GB of a 6 GB pool: they cannot both be resident,

    failure. Measured from the journal on 2026-09-20 at 07:02:10 -- a seat load
    timed out with `context canceled` after the daemon spent twenty seconds
    walking `ngl_per_device_high[1].n_layer` down from 48, trying to pack every
