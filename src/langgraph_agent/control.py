Deliberately a module-level object rather than a field on `AgentState`. The
graph is compiled without a checkpointer, so LangGraph's `update_state` /
`interrupt` machinery is unavailable and nothing outside a node can write into a
state the graph is already streaming. A flag the nodes read is the only channel
that reaches a run in progress.

The stop is cooperative. Nothing here interrupts anything: it sets a flag, and
the checkpoints in `nodes.py` and `serve.py` decline to start the *next* piece of
work. Work already in flight -- a `filesystem_write`, a staged commit, a test
run, a model call -- always finishes, because the alternative is a half-written
