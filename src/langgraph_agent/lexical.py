"""Okapi BM25 over the corpus's chunks -- the lexical half of `search`.

Dense retrieval alone misses the queries this corpus is most often asked. A
plan naming `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` or `_report_path_key` is asking about
one identifier defined in one file, and an embedding of 384 dimensions is a
poor instrument for "contains this exact rare token": the model was trained to
put *similar* passages near each other, and every seat-timeout constant in this
project is similar to every other one. Measured against ground truth that
cannot be argued with -- 541 identifiers each defined in exactly one project
file, asked about in a natural question -- dense retrieval put the defining
file first 53.4% of the time and dense-plus-lexical 65.1%, with the paired
McNemar test at p < 0.001 (85 queries fixed against 22 broken). Recall at 5
moved 93.0% to 95.4%, which says where the gain comes from: the defining file
was nearly always retrieved, and simply not ranked first.

Three decisions in here are not interchangeable with the obvious alternatives.

*BM25 re-ranks the dense candidates rather than retrieving in parallel.* Full
fusion -- two independent retrievals over the whole corpus, merged -- measured
67.3% against re-ranking's 66.2% on the same 541 queries, a difference of six
and well inside the noise. It costs much more than it sounds: a document that only the
lexical side found has no dense score, and `RETRIEVAL_RELEVANCE_FLOOR` is read
off `results[0]["score"]` to decide whether the corpus answered at all. Buying
one percentage point by making the gate's input sometimes-absent is a bad
trade, so every result still comes from the dense window and still carries the
cosine that window gave it.

*Identifiers are indexed whole **and** in pieces.* `tokenize` emits
`builder_deadline_seconds` alongside `builder`, `deadline` and `seconds`, so a
question that spells the constant exactly matches it, and one that describes it
in words still matches something. Emitting only the pieces would make
`NODE_DEADLINE_SECONDS` and `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` near-identical, which is
the very confusion the lexical half is here to resolve.

*Ranks are fused, not scores.* A BM25 score is unbounded and corpus-relative
while a cosine sits in [-1, 1]; any weighted sum of the two needs a scaling
constant that is really a third hyperparameter, tuned on one corpus and wrong
on the next. Reciprocal rank fusion needs no such constant.
