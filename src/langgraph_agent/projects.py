"""Generated projects: where a run's files land, and whether the corpus reads them.

A run pointed at a project writes under `projects/<name>/` instead of into the
checkout, and that directory stays out of the corpus until the operator opts it
in: whether a finished project is knowledge the Researcher should have is the
operator's decision.

The opt-in is a file on disk (`EMBEDDED_PROJECTS_FILE`), not a write into the
store, because the corpus is a function of what the walk finds and a rebuild
prunes everything else. It is JSON, which the walk never indexes, and it sits
beside the project directories, so a Builder confined to one cannot opt itself
in through `filesystem_write`.

This module imports nothing from the rest of the package, because
`graphrag_server` imports it for the walk.
