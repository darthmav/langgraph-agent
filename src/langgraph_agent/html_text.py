"""HTML to text, ours rather than a library's.

A fetched page is mostly not the page. Navigation, cookie banners, related-post
rails and footers are the bulk of the markup, and embedding them is not a
cosmetic problem here: a chunk of link text scores against queries the way any
other chunk does, so boilerplate does not sit inertly in the corpus, it
*competes* with the passage that answers the question. The corpus already
learned this once from the other direction -- a document embedded in one
`encode()` call was represented by its preamble, and the file that answered the
query lost to a shorter one that merely mentioned it.

The technique is **link density plus block length**, which is what separates
prose from chrome without knowing anything about the site. A navigation strip
is short blocks that are almost entirely anchor text; an article is long blocks
that are almost entirely not. Neither test works alone -- a heading is short
prose, and a paragraph citing three sources is long and link-heavy -- so a
block is dropped only when it is *both* short and link-dominated, and headings
are exempt from the length test entirely because a heading is short by nature
and is the one short thing worth keeping.

Written here rather than taken from a library for two reasons. The obvious one
is that it costs nothing and adds no dependency tree. The one that matters more
is that this is a *measurement surface*: `ExtractedPage` reports how many blocks
it kept, how many it dropped and whether it fell back, so a page that came back
thin says so and can be graded, rather than being an empty string out of a
black box. Everything else in this project that decides what enters the corpus
-- the relevance floor, the chunker, the duplicate scan -- was tuned against
numbers it printed, and an extractor that cannot be tuned the same way would be
the one unmeasured link in that chain.
