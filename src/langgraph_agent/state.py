    Attributes:
        goal: The user's original goal/objective
        messages: Conversation history / log
        architecture: Architectural direction and constraints from the Architect
        verdict: The Architect's ruling (Verdict enum value)
        plan: Structured plan from Planner
        research: Findings from Researcher
        builder_report: Implementation report from Builder
        next_agent: Which agent runs next ("Researcher" | "Builder" | "END")
        research_status: Status from Researcher (ready_for_builder | need_replan | no_relevant_knowledge)
        blockers: What's blocking progress (set by Builder when stuck)
        discuss_only: Set by the caller, never by an agent. The seats reason
            about the goal and the Builder is offered no tools at all -- no
            read, no write, no terminal, no tests -- so a run cannot change the
            project. The online research phase is off for the same reason: it
            writes pages to disk and embeds them.
        files_changed: List of file paths modified by Builder
        failed_verification: Files the Builder wrote that did not pass
            verification -- they ran and failed, or nobody executed them. Set
            by the Builder every pass and carried into the next, so a file
            clears only by passing, never by omission.
        unverified: The part of failed_verification nobody executed, because
            the deadline or the emergency stop came first. It blocks approval
            whatever expect_failures says: that opt-out is for a file meant to
            fail, not for a gap in the evidence.
        builder_cut_off: Why the Builder's last pass ended before it finished
            -- "turn_cap" or "deadline" -- or empty when it finished. While it
            is set the Architect cannot approve.
        lint_failed: Python files the Builder wrote or carried that still fail
            `ruff check` after the fixes it is allowed to make. Re-linted every
            pass until clean, and blocking approval whatever expect_failures
            says.
        expect_failures: Per-run opt-out, set by the caller and never by an
            agent. A file that runs and fails is still executed, still reported
            and still listed in failed_verification -- it just stops blocking
            approval and sets no blocker. For goals whose product is a failing
            file: a deliberate fixture, an expected-to-fail test.
        step_count: Number of steps taken (for loop limit)
