# with ~1 GB held by whatever else had just started) and the fourth, 12s later,

# Ollama loads one at a 4,096-token window with a 2,048-token batch by default,
# and on two 3 GB cards qwen3-embedding then asked for 7,463 MiB
# against 6,217 free -- 4,453 of weights, 576 of KV cache and 2,433 of compute
# buffers sized for that batch -- so the daemon ran 25 of its 37 layers on the
# cards and the rest on the CPU, at 0.24 passages/s. At 512 it takes 4,987 MiB,
# 37 of 37 on the cards, at 0.48 passages/s, and the vectors do not move:
# cosine 1.000000 against the default load on the corpus's eight longest
# passages, which peaked at 362 of its tokens. A longer input -- a query that
# is a whole plan -- is cut at 511 tokens rather than refused, which is still
# twice the chunker's 254-token passages. 1,024 fits as well (5,403 MiB) at
# the same speed with half the room to spare. Every call sends the same options because the
# daemon reloads a model whose options changed, so a search at another window
# would evict the runner an index is using.
#
# num_gpu puts every layer on the cards, and the window alone no longer did.
# Measured 2026-09-16 on Ollama 0.33.3's CUDA 12 build (cuda-embed-ollama.sh):
# with 5.6 GiB free across the two cards, the daemon's own estimate offloaded
# 24 of 37 layers -- 70% on the GPU, a batch of 8 in 23.4s -- and left 1.1 GB
# unused on each card. Forced, all 37 load (4,995 MiB, 100% on the GPU), a batch
# of 8 takes 6.5s, a 511-token input still runs, and the cards sit at 2,424 and
# 2,947 of 3,072 MiB. The cost is the failure mode: where the model does not
# fit, the load errors instead of spilling onto the CPU, which is what "wholly
# on the GPU" asks for. Vectors from a split load differ slightly (cosine
# 0.9986 at worst on eight passages), so a corpus is built on the placement it

# Capitalised tokens that are not entities. `add_document` mints an entity for

# numpy-style docstrings that rule fires constantly on words whose capital is
# an artefact of where they sit rather than of what they mean: a sentence
# opener (`Every`, `Nothing`, `Without`), a docstring section header
# (`Returns`, `Parameters`, `Raises`), a report heading (`Files`, `Status`), or
# a Python literal (`False`, `None`). Measured before this list, `False` was
# the 4th best-connected node in the graph and `Returns` the 6th, above
# `Fiedler`, `Planner` and `Cheeger`: 21 documents share an edge through
# `Returns`, which says only that all 21 contain a docstring.
#
# **This list does not exist to make `topics()` decisive, and it does not.**
# That was the first hypothesis and the measurement refused it: removing every
# one of the 97 entities that bridge this corpus's two topic areas -- the
# theoretical maximum any such filter could achieve -- moves the eigengap
# decisiveness from 1.12x to 1.09x. The corpus's spectrum is a smooth
# continuum because the corpus genuinely has no decisive k, not because
# boilerplate is gluing it together. What the list is for is the graph itself:
# an edge through `Returns` is a false claim that two documents are related,
# and `neighborhood()`, `top_entities` and `duplicate_entities` all read those
# edges as evidence.
#
# Matched case-insensitively against the whole token, never as a prefix. A
# **stopword list, not a heuristic**, on purpose: the obvious alternative is to
# drop a token that only ever appears where a capital is forced (line start,
# after a full stop), and it was built and measured. It removes the same noise
# and severs real edges doing it -- `Planner` 18 documents down to 15,
# `Spectral` 19 to 15, `ValueError` 14 to 11 -- because a term introduced in a
# bulleted list (`- **Planner** -- interprets goals`) never appears anywhere
# else in that document. Silently dropping a true relation to catch a false one
# is the wrong trade here, and a list a reader can audit line by line beats a
# rule whose failures are invisible. Measured on this corpus, this list removes
# 84 entities and 437 edges and costs **no** meaningful term a single edge.
#
# **A hand-audited list drifts, and this one did.** The claim above held when
# it was written and had stopped holding by 2026-09-09, because the corpus it
# was audited against had moved on -- much of it prose written *since*, in this
# file and in CLAUDE.md. `Tests`, `Measured` and `System` were the 6th, 8th and
# 10th best-connected entities in the graph, which is the exact failure the
# list exists to prevent, one vocabulary later. `Measured` is the sharpest:
# CLAUDE.md opens sentences with it ("Measured on this corpus...") twenty-nine
# times, so the prose recording these measurements was minting the entity.
#
# The additions below were chosen by counting, per token, the capitals that
# position does **not** explain -- not at a line start, not after a full stop,
# not the first cell of a table row. A token with zero of those is recording
# where it sits. That is the same heuristic rejected above, used the way it is
# sound: to *nominate* candidates for a human to rule on, never to filter. Two
# nominations were refused on that read and are the reason the pass is a hand
# audit rather than a script. `L_dense` scores zero free capitals because an
# assignment starts its line -- it is a real identifier and stays. `Spectral`
# scores two, both marginal, and stays because it is a term this corpus is
# about; the cost of a wrong removal is a severed true relation, which is
# exactly what the paragraph above refuses. `System`, `Search`, `State` and
# `Verification` were nominated by rank and cleared by the count: `System`
# alone carries 22 free capitals, so the entity is earned.
#
# It moved again on 2026-09-12, which is the point of the guard rather than a
# surprise: `Reported` and `Computed` each crossed the four-document floor at
# zero position-free capitals, as prose was written about what a phase reports
# and about what is computed where. Both are the `Measured` case exactly -- the
# writing-up of a change minting the entity -- and both joined the list by the
# same count. The lesson is not the two words: it is that this list is a claim
# about a vocabulary, and the vocabulary grows every time someone documents
# something -- and code is documented too: the same day an agent-written
# spectral-analysis module (the quisce prototype, since moved out of the
# checkout) took `Perform` and `Useful` across
# the floor, both docstring openers at zero position-free capitals, and `Prose`
# crossed it the same day as the first word of a comment's sentence.
#
# `Observed` crossed on 2026-09-18, and it is the plainest case of the pattern
# yet: this project records what it measured, so it opens sentences with the
# word for having seen something. Four documents, zero position-free capitals --
# two line starts, two after a full stop -- and it reached the floor within the
# one change that added a fourth, which is the guard doing exactly what it is
# for. Nothing here is *about* observation.

        """Search the knowledge base.

        Matches on chunks and answers in documents. `id` stays the document's
        path -- the thing callers index the graph with, print as a filename and
        derive an entity from -- while `content` becomes the passage that
        actually matched rather than the document's first 200 characters. That
        is the half of chunking the Researcher feels: it forwards
        `content[:300]` to the Builder, which used to be 300 characters of
        whichever file's *header* scored best.

        Chunks are oversampled and then collapsed onto their documents, keeping
        each document's best-scoring chunk. Collapsing is what makes `top_k`
        mean what every caller already assumed it meant: without it a query
        that matches six passages of one file would return that file six times
        and crowd out five other sources, which is worse than the pre-chunking
        behaviour rather than better.

        The retrieval is **hybrid**: the dense window is re-ranked against BM25
        before it is collapsed. Dense similarity is a poor instrument for "this
        passage contains this exact rare identifier", which is what a plan
        naming `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` is really asking. Measured through
        this method against the real store, on 541 identifiers each defined in
        exactly one project file, the defining file came first 53.4% of the
        time on dense alone and 65.1% with the re-rank (McNemar p < 0.001, 85
        fixed against 22 broken). The prose case improved too -- 66.0% to 68.2%
        on 400 held-out passages -- so this is not a code-search special case
        bought at the expense of ordinary questions. See `lexical.py` for why
        it re-ranks rather than retrieving in parallel, and why ranks are fused
        rather than scores.

        `score` therefore stays exactly what it was: the dense cosine of the
        chunk that matched. Every candidate comes from the dense window, so
        there is no result whose score had to be invented -- which matters
        because the relevance floor is read off the first one to decide
        whether the corpus answered at all.

        the console makes on every click, and a caller who only wants the node
        list should not pay it.

        Sides are named `center` and `other` rather than by the sign of the

        negation are equally valid, so a raw sign would swap the two halves

        sometimes *meaningful*. A sign cut exists for any connected graph; what

        divided) to 0.006 (a five-hop sweep spanning two topic areas). The
        caller is given the number rather than a bare verdict because the
