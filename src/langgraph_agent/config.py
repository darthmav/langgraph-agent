"""Seats, model tags and LLM setup, and the Ollama daemon's circuit.

Each of the four seats can run a different model on a different provider.
Inference defaults to local: every seat runs a model the Ollama daemon on this
machine serves from its own weights, so a fresh checkout needs no API key and
no ollama.com credentials. Ollama Cloud tags and Anthropic remain available
per seat. The embedding model runs on the same daemon but belongs to GraphRAG,
never to a seat.
