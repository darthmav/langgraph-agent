# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Project Overview

This is **langgraph-agent**, a cloud-only 4-Agent AI system for software development experiments.

- **Architect** — the leading authority. Sets architectural direction before planning, then holds the approval gate: the run ends on its `approved` verdict, not the Builder's say-so. No tools.
- **Planner** — interprets goals, creates structured plans, routes to next agent.
- **Researcher** — gathers context via the GraphRAG MCP tool (`search_knowledge_graph`).
- **Builder** — implements plans using filesystem, git, terminal, and test MCP tools.

Inference is cloud-only. The embedding runs locally through the Ollama daemon
serving `qwen3-embedding:latest` -- the daemon owns the model's placement, so
nothing in this project touches torch or a card itself. The embedding belongs
to GraphRAG, not to a seat.

Tech stack: Python 3.12+, LangGraph, Chroma + NetworkX, MCP (local stdio-compatible tool binding).

## Quick Reference

## Conventions

- **Python formatting/linting:** `ruff` configured in `ruff.toml`.
- **Type checking:** `mypy` configured in `mypy.ini`.
- **Tests:** `pytest` in `tests/`.
- **Default seats** (`DEFAULT_SEATS` in `config.py`):

  | Seat | Provider | Model |
  |---|---|---|
  | Architect | ollama | `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` |
  | Planner | ollama | `kimi-k3:cloud` |
  | Researcher | ollama | `kimi-k3:cloud` |
  | Builder | ollama | `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` |

  Anthropic and OpenAI remain optional cloud providers; no seat uses either by
  default, so a fresh checkout runs without an API key of its own. `:cloud`
  tags are proxied to ollama.com by the local daemon, which holds the
  credentials.
- **Never send `temperature` to a modern Anthropic model.** Sampling parameters
  were removed on the Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 / 4.6+ families and are rejected with a
  400 that reads like an auth failure. `_accepts_temperature()` gates this.
- **Tool specialization (critical):** Architect and Planner get no tools; the
  Researcher gets GraphRAG read-only tools only; the Builder gets filesystem,
  git, terminal and test tools only. Keep GraphRAG out of `BUILDER_TOOLS`.
- **`self_healing` is a standalone utility, not wired into any node.** Reach
  for its `retry_with_backoff` / `circuit_breaker` decorators at a *new*
  integration point, never retrofitted onto the seat or MCP call paths, which
  have a resilience design of their own (the deadlines below, and the rule that
  work under a deadline never writes to state).

## State Schema

Every node reads/writes `AgentState`:

```python
{
    "goal": str,
    "architecture": str,
    "verdict": "plan" | "approved" | "revise" | "need_research",
    "messages": list[str],
    "plan": str,
    "research": str,
    "builder_report": str,
    "next_agent": "Researcher" | "Builder" | "END",
  "research_status": "ready_for_builder" | "need_replan" |
  "no_relevant_knowledge", "blockers": str, "files_changed": list[str],
  "failed_verification": list[str], "unverified": list[str],
  "builder_cut_off": "" | "turn_cap" | "deadline", "lint_failed": list[str],
  "expect_failures": bool, "discuss_only": bool, "output_dir": str,
  "step_count": int,
}
```

`stopped`, `stop_reason`, `run_id` and `elapsed_s` are added to the payload
`run_goal` returns, not to `AgentState`: that schema describes what the agents
write, not how the run ended.

The Architect writes `architecture` and `verdict`; the verdict is what routes
the loop and what ends it. `step_count` is incremented by the Architect gate,
not by the Builder — every cycle passes the gate, but a Planner/Researcher loop
never reaches the Builder and would otherwise run uncounted.

## Common Tasks

### Run the test suite
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Add a new Builder tool
1. Add the method to `_discover_tools()` in `src/langgraph_agent/mcp_client.py`,
   named under `filesystem_`, `git_`, `terminal_` or `test_`.
2. Add its JSON schema to `BUILDER_TOOLS` in `src/langgraph_agent/nodes.py` --
   a tool the MCP client exposes and `BUILDER_TOOLS` omits is refused by name.
3. Add a test, and update the README's MCP Integration section.

### Add a new Researcher tool
Read-only GraphRAG tools only: extend `src/langgraph_agent/graphrag_server.py`
and expose it through `mcp_client.py`.

### Change a seat's model
Update `DEFAULT_SEATS` and `_DEFAULT_AGENT_MODELS` in
`src/langgraph_agent/config.py`, the seat table above, and `.env.example`; add
the tag to `AGENT_LLM_OPTIONS`, which is the whole offer -- `set_seat` refuses
anything not in it and `test_rpc_params.py` pins the list. Check the tag
reports `tools` before seating it as the Builder: that seat's work *is* tool
calls, and `get_agent_status` puts a **NO TOOLS** chip on its card alone.

### Add a fifth agent
`AGENTS` in `config.py` is the seat list everything iterates. Adding one means:
a node in `nodes.py`, a prompt in `prompts/`, wiring plus a router in
`graph.py`, entries in `AGENTS` / `DEFAULT_SEATS` / `_DEFAULT_AGENT_MODELS`, a
`StubLLM` branch, and a `ROLE_COLOR` entry in `frontend/index.html`.

### The console API
One `POST /rpc` taking `{method, params}` and returning `{result, elapsed_ms}`
or `{error: {message}, elapsed_ms}`; methods live in `RPC_METHODS` in
`serve.py`, and the `/api/*` routes are compatibility wrappers over the same
functions (`launch_console.sh` polls `/api/status`, so it must keep working).
Parameters are typed, bounded and refused by name (`_int_param`, `_float_param`,
`_bool_param`, `_str_param`), parsed before anything is touched.
`run_goal` blocks its own thread for the whole run -- hence
`ThreadingHTTPServer` -- and a second one is refused while it is in flight.

## Important Notes

- Do not let every agent call every tool; the specialization is the whole point.
- Empty state fields must render as `(empty)` in the state injection block.
- **The Builder's account of its own work is not evidence.** `files_changed` is
  appended only when a write tool reports success, never from prose.
  `state["files_changed"]` accumulates across passes while the local list in
  `builder_node` is this pass alone, and a path no longer on disk is retracted
  from the record and named in the report. "Described but not written" compares
  both spellings through `_report_path_key`.
- **Writes cannot leave the project.** `_resolve_write_path` resolves the
  parent, not the leaf; on a run given a project, `_outside_output_dir` confines
  writes to `projects/<name>`.
- **What a pass writes is run and linted.** `_verify_written_files` executes
  every `RUNNABLE_SUFFIXES` file (a module inside a package is imported, not
  executed) and `_lint_written_files` runs `ruff check` with the project's own
  config first. Files that failed earlier are re-checked until clean. A file
  nobody ran (`unverified`), a lint failure, and a pass cut off before it
  finished all block approval; `expect_failures` suppresses only the
  runtime-failure block, never the others.
- Verification runs headless (`HEADLESS_VERIFY_ENV`) and with `stdin` closed.
- **`terminal_execute` has no shell.** The command is `shlex.split` and run
  directly, so metacharacters are inert data; `SHELL_OPERATORS` and
  `_GLUED_REDIRECT` refuse operators that survive as whole argv tokens, `cwd`
  replaces `cd` (validated by `_resolve_cwd`), and a requested `timeout` is
  clamped by `TERMINAL_TIMEOUT_MAX_SECONDS`. A timeout reports the tail of what
  the file printed.
- **`git_dwell` runs its stages in fixed order** -- survey, branch, stage,
  commit, push, pr, merge -- whatever order the caller lists them in, and it
  will not commit onto the default branch. The default pipeline ends at
  `merge` (`--squash --delete-branch`); naming `stages` without it stops at
  `pr`. Nothing staged is a success, and `paths` commits only what it names.
- **`expect_failures`, `research_web` and `discuss_only` are per-run flags set
  by the caller, never by an agent.** A discussion run binds no tools at all
  and forces online research off.
- **Work run under `_with_deadline` must not write to state** -- the abandoned
  worker cannot be cancelled and may finish after the node returned. The
  Builder's deadline never abandons a tool call. A timed-out Architect can
  never rule `approved`, and a timed-out or off-format Planner must leave a
  non-empty `plan` (`_PLANNER_TIMED_OUT`, `_PLANNER_NO_STEPS`), since the gate
  counts a step only while a plan exists.
- **A silent Researcher is not research**: `_said_nothing` routes to the
  Builder and names the seat's model. Every exit from `researcher_node` sets
  `research_status`, and `_route_from_planner` forces the opening cycle through
  the Researcher.
- **Retrieval decides whether a seat is consulted at all.** `_gather_research`
  returns the retrieved chunks without invoking the Researcher's model whenever
  the top hit clears `relevance_floor()` -- measured per corpus into
  `floor_calibration.json`, `None` until it has been, and never borrowed
  between embedding models. Search is hybrid: BM25 re-ranks the dense window
  (`lexical.py`), ranks fused rather than scores, so every result keeps the
  cosine the floor is read off.
- **Documents are embedded in chunks** (`CHUNK_MAX_TOKENS` 254 against a
  256-token window); `search` collapses chunks back onto documents, and a
  document's previous chunks are deleted before its new ones land.
- **No corpus exists until someone indexes one, and reading is not indexing.**
  `get_knowledge_base()` creates and is reserved for indexing;
  `open_knowledge_base()` returns `None` and is what every read goes through.
  The corpus is rebuilt when the console starts and again before every run
  (`INDEX_PROJECT_BEFORE_RUN=0` switches off both), `_claim_the_rebuild` holds
  an `flock` beside the store so two consoles cannot interleave rebuilds, and a
  reindex rebuilds rather than accumulates while keeping the vectors of
  unchanged documents.
- **Changing the corpus is refused while a run or a rebuild is in flight**
  (`clear_corpus`, `upload_document`); `export_corpus` is not, since reading
  takes nothing away. `clear()` empties Chroma first, then the graph, then the
  floor record, and must reach disk.
- **An uploaded document is a file first**: `store_uploaded_document` writes
  under `uploads/` and only then embeds, so `uploads/` must stay *out* of
  `PROJECT_INDEX_EXCLUDES` or the next rebuild deletes the upload silently.
- Fetched pages under `research/web/` and `ENTITY_FREE_SUFFIXES` files are
  retrievable but mint no entities, decided from the path so a reindex cannot
  reverse it. `connectivity()` reports them apart from real isolates.
- **`ENTITY_STOPWORDS` is a hand-audited list, not a rule.** Re-run the
  position-free-capital count when the vocabulary moves -- in either direction,
  since deleting files moves it too -- and the pinned top-twenty in
  `test_claims.py` is what tells you it has.
- `PROJECT_INDEX_EXCLUDES` entries are matched as plain substrings, not globs.
- **There is exactly one embedding model** (`EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`), a corpus
  belongs to it, and `set_embedding_model` refuses: vectors from two models
  share no space. The chunker cuts with that model's own tokenizer.
- **Placement is the daemon's, and only one model is on the cards.**
  `OLLAMA_EMBED_OPTIONS` and `OLLAMA_SEAT_GPU_OPTIONS` force every layer onto
  the GPU, `GPU_ARBITER` (`control.py`) serializes the embedder against the
  seats and evicts the resident model, and a seat whose forced load does not
  fit is rebuilt unforced and retried once.
- **The emergency stop is cooperative.** `RUN_CONTROL` is a process-global
  checked at node tops, in the Builder's turn loop, before each verified file
  and between supersteps -- never inside a tool batch. Every exit path writes
  `runs/last_run.json`, and `shutdown` defers the exit to the run's own
  `finally` under `_run_lock`.
- **Three nested timeouts, none redundant**: `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` bounds one
  provider call at the socket (spelled differently per provider),
  `NODE_DEADLINE_SECONDS` / `BUILDER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` bound a node turn, and
  `RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS` bounds the run but is checked only between supersteps.
- The seat lights come from `ACTIVITY` and `run_progress.turns`, never
  `run_progress["node"]`, which names the seat that just *finished*; the
  embedder's light comes from `EMBEDDER_ACTIVITY`.
- A seat with no credentials silently becomes `StubLLM`. Key presence is not
  liveness: `get_agent_status()` reports the real outcome of each call
  (`_seat_failures`), and `stubbed` and `live` failures are worded apart.
- A seat's thinking box says what its next call does: a switchable model is
  always sent the flag, off included, since omitting it means *on*.
- Knowledge base files under `knowledge/` are runtime artifacts, and
  `__pycache__` is never committed.
- **The container joins this machine's network** (`network_mode: host`): the
  daemon, PostgreSQL and SearxNG are all loopback-only on the host. The daemon
  stays on the host, the checkout arrives as a bind mount, and `docker stop`
  asks for the same exit the console's X does.

## Documentation claims are tests

`tests/test_claims.py` exists because prose goes stale silently: **a claim
worth writing down is a claim worth failing a build over.** Most of its guards
*recompute* the claim from the repository -- every cited path resolves, the
Project Structure tree matches disk in both directions, the seat table matches
`DEFAULT_SEATS`, the documented Python floor matches `pyproject.toml`, no
walked file exceeds `MAX_INDEXABLE_BYTES` (and none passes
`INDEXABLE_WARN_RATIO` of it), and CI runs the same commands the Quick
Reference does.

Two are different. A figure quoted in prose is checked against its constant
through a small registry -- better still, name the constant and let the reader
look it up. And the top-twenty entity audit **cannot** be a rule, so it is
*pinned*: when it fails, a newcomer has reached the top twenty and the audit is
asking to be redone, not reporting a bug. Its census counts only the files
every checkout has, so `uploads/`, `projects/` and fetched pages are out.

## Troubleshooting

- **GraphRAG returns no results** -- Check whether there is a corpus at all; the
  header reads `no corpus` when none has been built. One is built when the
  console starts and again before the Architect opens, from the directory the
  server was started in, so the usual causes are a server started somewhere
  with nothing to index, or `INDEX_PROJECT_BEFORE_RUN=0`.
- **No LLM output / canned text** -- A seat pointed at Anthropic or OpenAI needs
  that provider's key in `.env`; without one it runs `StubLLM` and the console
  shows a `NO KEY` chip. Ollama seats need the daemon running and signed in
  (`ollama signin`) for `:cloud` tags.
- **A 400 from Anthropic that looks like an auth error** -- Something is passing
  `temperature` to an Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 / 4.6+ model.
- **The embedder is on the CPU, or embedding is slow** -- `ollama ps` names the
  split. `journalctl -u ollama` reading `skipping CUDA device` means Arch's
  CUDA 13 build on a card it cannot drive: run `./cuda-embed-ollama.sh`.
- **A local seat runs mostly on the CPU, or one card looks untouched** --
  the forced load failed and the seat rebuilt itself unforced; the journal names
  the allocation that did not fit. A model larger than the cards is *meant* to
  read that way. Two models resident at once means something reached the daemon
  around `GPU_ARBITER`.
- **The header reads `stale: N not indexed` right after startup** -- Read the
  `[Corpus]` line in `/tmp/ambiguity-console.log`: it names each file that
  failed and why, usually a model load short of GPU memory.
- **Online research finds nothing, or reports DuckDuckGo's bot check** -- Check
  `SEARXNG_URL` is in `.env` and the instance answers; an HTTP 403 means `json`
  is missing from its `search.formats`.
- **`docker` says permission denied, or nothing answers on port 5432** -- The
  `docker` group applies only after a reboot, and Omarchy enables only the
  socket, so `docker.service` must be enabled for the database to come back up.
- **Tests are slow** -- The first run opens Chroma; later runs reuse the cached
  singleton.

## Where the reasoning went

This file used to carry the rationale behind every rule above -- what was
measured, what was tried and rejected, and which incident each guard came from.
It was cut on 2026-09-20 because a memory file is loaded into every session and
it had reached 150,060 characters. **The full text is the commit before that
one:** `git show 2074d08:CLAUDE.md`, and `git log -p CLAUDE.md` for how each
rule arrived. Before changing a rule above, read its paragraph there -- most of
them record an alternative that was built, measured and rejected.
