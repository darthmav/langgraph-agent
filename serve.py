    Shared by the two methods that write to it, because the hazard is the same

    not break the Researcher's search -- that is the problem. A cleared corpus
    returns no hits, and a corpus in the middle of a rebuild returns whatever
    fraction of itself has been re-added so far; either reads as
    `no_relevant_knowledge` and routes the run as though the knowledge base had
    simply had nothing useful to say. Nothing raises, nothing is logged, and
    the run goes on to plan around an absence that was manufactured out from
    under it. The seat cannot find out, so the operator is told instead.

    A startup index is refused on the same grounds and reported apart, because
    it is the hazard without the run: `_index_the_project_at_startup` holds the
    corpus mid-rebuild for tens of seconds with nothing running, so a clear
    landing in there empties a store that is being re-added to and an upload
    mutates the same graph the rebuild is walking. What the operator has to do
    about it differs too -- a run is theirs to stop, a rebuild is theirs to wait
    out -- and one refusal offering to stop a run that does not exist is the
    wrong instruction rather than a vague one.

    Reads both flags under `_run_lock` and names the goal, the way
    `rpc_shutdown` refuses: a refusal that does not say what is running leaves
    the operator to guess whether they still care about it.

    `_index_lock` serializes the two phases inside one process, and that is all
    it can do: two consoles started in one checkout share the store on disk and
    not the lock in memory, so both could prune and clear it at once. That was
    hard to reach while a run was the only thing that rebuilt -- two runs at
    once needed two servers *and* someone starting a goal in each -- and the
    startup index makes it ordinary: every console rebuilds the moment it comes
    up, so two consoles is two rebuilds with nothing between them. The port
    stops the common case (the server binds before this thread starts, so a
    second console on the same port never gets here) and stops nothing on
    `PORT=8081`.

    So the claim is an `flock` on a file beside the store. Three properties are
    why it is that and not a pid file: the kernel owns it, so it is released by
    the process *dying* as surely as by the process finishing and there is no
    such thing as a stale claim to clear up; the file's existence means nothing,
    so a leftover empty file after a reboot claims naught; and it is taken
    non-blockingly, so "somebody else is rebuilding" is an answer rather than a
    wait nobody bounded. `flock` conflicts between two descriptors in one
    process as well, so this would serialize the two phases on its own --
    `_index_lock` is kept because a lock in memory is where a *waiting* thread
    belongs, and because it means only one thread per process ever opens the
    file.

    Yields True when the claim is held for the body, False when another process
    holds it and `wait_seconds` ran out. A machine where the claim cannot be
    taken at all -- no `fcntl`, or a directory that cannot be written -- yields
    True and relies on `_index_lock` alone: the lock is an extra guarantee about
    a rare collision, and refusing to index because it could not be taken would

    Rebuilding the corpus was a run's job alone, and a run is something the
    operator asks for -- so between runs the header reported drift it had no
    way to fix, and restarting the server did not clear it: starting up only
    *opens* the store, and the one thing that rebuilds it was behind a request
    to search it. There is no Reindex button either; it was removed because a
    run does this, which was the right reason and left the state where a run is
    not what the operator wants unattended.

    Observed on 2026-09-18. A commit added `ollama_client.py` and put
    `experimental/` into `PROJECT_INDEX_EXCLUDES`; the store was two days older
    than both, so the header read `stale: 1 not indexed, 1 not in the walk` and
    went on reading it across every restart, correctly and permanently. The
    only route to a current corpus was to start a run nobody wanted, which is
    the button again wearing a worse hat -- and a standing stale verdict that
    the operator cannot act on is the credibility problem `corpus_health`
    measures every file's size twice to avoid, one level up.

    Five decisions in it are not interchangeable with the obvious alternatives.

    *It is started from `main()` and never at import.* This module used to fill
    `kb` from a thread started at import, so importing it -- which the whole
    test suite does -- created a store on disk and loaded the embedding model
    whether or not anybody wanted a corpus. `main()` is the one entry point
    that means a person is running the console.

    *It does not block readiness.* `launch_console.sh` polls `/api/status` and
    opens a browser when it answers, so indexing before `serve_forever` would
    present a server that never came up -- tens of seconds warm on this
    project, minutes on a first build. It runs on its own thread, the header
    reports it, and the staleness verdict is withheld while it does, for the
    reason it is withheld mid-run.

    *A run wins, and does not wait.* `should_stop` is "a run has claimed the
    flag, or the console is exiting", so a run started into a build takes over
    within one embedding batch and finishes the job through its own phase --
    what is already embedded keeps its vectors, so nothing is done twice.
    Making the *run* wait instead would hold `running` True with no node on the
    stack for up to a whole build, which is exactly what a wedged run looks
    like from the console.

    *It counts the walk before it opens the door*, through `_rebuild_the_corpus`
    -- a machine with nothing to index must keep reporting `absent`, because
    only `absent` means nothing has ever been built here.

    *And it obeys `INDEX_PROJECT_BEFORE_RUN`.* One switch rather than two,
    because there is one question -- may this machine rebuild its own corpus --
    and a machine that wants a frozen corpus wants it frozen at startup too.

    The relevance floor is still measured by the first run rather than here:
    `_calibrate_the_floor_before_the_run` writes into the run feed, and a
    corpus this phase has just finished makes that a matter of seconds.

    Two *consoles* in one checkout are a different collision and are not
    `_index_lock`'s to stop -- they share the store on disk and not the lock in
    memory. The port stops the common case, since the server binds before this
    thread starts and a second console on the same port never gets here, and it
    stops nothing on `PORT=8081`. This was a rare shape while a run was the only
    thing that rebuilt, needing two servers *and* a goal started in each; a
    phase that rebuilds the moment a console comes up makes it ordinary, so
    `_claim_the_rebuild` takes an `flock` beside the store and a second console
    finds the corpus `busy_elsewhere` and leaves it alone -- correctly, since the
    process holding it is rebuilding the same corpus from the same walk.

    A fresh install has no corpus, and nothing used to bring one into being
    except the operator asking for it by name. Missing that costs nothing
    visible: `search_knowledge_graph` answers `no_corpus`, `_gather_research`
    falls through to the Researcher's own model, and the Builder works from
    whatever that model remembers. Nothing raises, nothing is logged, and the
    run reports itself finished. The same silence covers the other half of the
    problem -- a corpus that was built once and has been drifting from the
    project ever since. Measured here on 2026-09-09: 8 documents in the store
    against a walk offering 103, every project query under
    the relevance floor, and `rag_stats` reporting `indexed` with every
    counter non-zero and consistent.

    Both were left to a button. There is no button now: this runs on **every**
    run, and it is why there is nothing left for anyone to press. It is no
    longer the only phase that rebuilds -- `_index_the_project_at_startup` does
    the same work when the console comes up, because a run is something the
    operator asks for and the corpus drifts between runs. This one stays, and
    stays unconditional: the startup index can have been stopped by the
    operator exiting, can have lost a race with a file written seconds ago, and
    on a long-running console is as old as the console is.

    Five decisions in it are not interchangeable with the obvious
    alternatives.

    *It rebuilds every time rather than only when the corpus is missing.* That
    is affordable because `index_project_files` keeps the vectors of documents
    whose text still hashes to what the store holds -- measured warm on this
    project, 52.0s to re-embed 77 files and 0.09s when nothing changed, with
    the embedding model never loaded in the second case. A rebuild gated on
    `absent`/`empty` would have been cheap in the same way and would have left
    drift exactly where it was: the state that needs fixing most is the one
    where every counter already looks right.

    *It compares content, not the walk.* `corpus_staleness` answers the
    header's question -- which documents are in one and not the other -- and it
    cannot see an edit, because an edited file is in both. The Builder edits
    files, so that is the common case here rather than the exotic one.

    *It runs before the online research phase, not after.* That phase embeds
    the pages it keeps and writes them under `research/web/`, which is inside
    the walk -- so a rebuild afterwards would re-read them from disk, and a
    rebuild before leaves them to be added on top. Going second also meant a
    corpus holding nothing but fetched pages counted above zero. A test pins
    the order.

    *It counts the walk before it opens the door*, now through
    `_rebuild_the_corpus`, which both phases share. `_kb_for_indexing()`
    creates the store, so calling it on a machine with nothing to index leaves
    an empty corpus behind and every later poll reports `empty` where the truth
    is `absent` -- and only one of those two means anything is wrong. That is
    exactly the mistake `research_online` made by resolving its door on the way
    in, one caller along, and it is guarded the same way: ask what there is to
    index first.

    *And a run already stopped does not start one.* The check is before the
    work rather than inside it, like every stop check guarding something that
    cannot be half-done: `index_project_files` clears the graph up front, so a
    rebuild abandoned midway is the half-finished corpus
    `_refuse_while_a_run_is_in_flight` exists to stop anyone else from
    manufacturing.

    A discussion run still does it, where it never researches online. That
    phase brings in material from outside and makes it a permanent corpus
    member; this one embeds files already on disk into a runtime artifact a
    reindex reproduces exactly, and adds nothing to the project. "Nothing was
    changed" is a promise about the project, and it still holds.

    That was wrong in a way worth recording, because the silence is

    nothing takes ~0.1s and loads no model, so an operator watching a second
    run sees the corpus line from the first one and then, for the rest of the
    project's life, nothing -- and reasonably concludes no embedding ever
    happens. That is the same failure `#run-live` fixed by naming the last

    skipped the work must not look identical. The `current` line is therefore
    the *cheapest* one to write and the most often read, and it says what it
    checked rather than merely that it ran.

def _research_online_before_the_run(goal: str, requested: bool) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Search the web for the goal and embed what earns a place. Never raises.

    Runs only when the caller asked for it (`requested`), and the caller is the
    operator -- never an agent, exactly as `expect_failures` is. That is a
    measured decision, not caution. Three gates were built and graded against
    thirteen hand-labelled pages from two real runs, and all three failed:
    ranking fetched pages against the project's own documents (a keyword-dense
    marketing page outscores every file in the checkout), skipping the phase
    when the corpus already answers the goal (backwards on the measurement --
    0.351 for a goal needing no web at all, 0.405 for one that did), and the
    calibrated relevance floor itself (3/13: every page cleared it).
    The lambda run shows why no fourth threshold will do better -- the *wrong*
    pages outscore the right ones on both instruments, 0.553-0.631 for AWS
    Lambda deployment guides against 0.459-0.550 for the Dolphin model pages
    the goal was actually about. "LAMBDA" meant a model on this machine and
    the web means AWS; "local project data" is, as a bag of words, generic
    project-documentation advice. The information that settles it is the
    operator's intent, and it is in no comparison of goal text to page text.

    The cost of guessing wrong is not one bad run. A fetched page becomes a
    permanent corpus member indistinguishable from project knowledge: after the
    run of 2026-09-11 the five blogs it kept took every one of the top five
    retrieval slots for that goal, shutting the project's own files out
    entirely, and would have gone on answering any query near "project
    documentation" for as long as they sat there.

    This runs **before** `graph.stream` and never during it, and that ordering
    is the design rather than a convenience. `_refuse_while_a_run_is_in_flight`
    refuses every other corpus write while a run is live because a corpus
    changing underneath the Researcher manufactures an absence no seat can
    detect: a rebuild half-done returns whatever fraction of itself has been
    re-added, which reads as `no_relevant_knowledge` and routes the run around
    a gap created out from under it. Doing the research first is not a way
    around that rule -- it is the only ordering that obeys it. By the time the
    Architect opens, the corpus is whole and stays that way for the rest of the
    run.

    It reaches the Researcher through the **corpus**, not through state. There
    is deliberately no path by which a fetched page skips retrieval: the pages
    are embedded, and the Researcher finds them with the same search, the same
    hybrid re-rank and the same relevance floor it applies to everything else.
    A web page that cannot be retrieved for this goal should not reach the
    Builder just because it was fetched for it.

    The creating door (`_kb_for_indexing`) is correct here, unlike everywhere
    else the console reads: this *is* indexing, and a goal researched against a
    machine with no corpus should leave one behind holding what it found. The
    staleness report will then say, accurately, that the project's own files
    are still missing from it.

    It is handed over **unopened** for that same sentence to hold. Passing
    `_kb_for_indexing()` created the store on the way into a phase that had not
    yet read a page and might never store one -- switched off, or a goal the
    web cannot answer -- so a machine that had never been indexed came out of
    its first run reporting `empty` instead of `absent`. `research_online`
    calls it on the first page that earns a place.

    Every failure is swallowed into the report. A goal the web cannot answer,
    a search engine that is down, a machine with no network -- none of those is
    a reason to refuse to run against the corpus already on disk, and the
    report distinguishes them so the feed can say which happened.
