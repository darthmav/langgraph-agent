"""Tests for how much retrieved evidence reaches the Builder.

Retrieval is expensive and careful — dense recall, a BM25 re-rank, a relevance
floor, a collapse back onto documents — and all of it is wasted if the passage
it selects is then cut down before the Builder reads it. Two things were doing
that: the search asked for five results and only three were forwarded, and each
was truncated to 300 characters of a passage averaging 882.

The truncation is the part worth pinning, because of *which* 300 characters it
kept. A chunk is chosen because it matched, and the matching sentence can be
anywhere in it, so keeping the opening third keeps the part with no particular
reason to be relevant. On a `research/web` document the opening is the
provenance header, and the top-scoring source of the 2026-09-09 run reached the
Builder as a title, a URL, a timestamp and the goal it was fetched for, cut
mid-word, with none of the article attached.
