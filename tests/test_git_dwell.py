"""Tests for `git_dwell`, the ordered git pipeline.

Every test drives a real temporary repository. `git` is real here -- the
pipeline's whole job is to run commands in the right order and report what
happened, and a mock would be testing the mock. `gh` is not: opening a pull
request needs a remote and an account, so the `pr` and `merge` stages are
exercised through a stub `gh` placed on PATH, which records how it was called.

What matters most is the one thing the pipeline *refuses*: it never commits
onto the default branch. That is the guarantee a caller relies on, and the
reason the rest can be a default -- the work arrives on a branch, through a
pull request, with the diff and the checks attached, whatever else runs. The
merge used to be the second refusal and is now the last stage of the default;
the opt-out it became is pinned here beside it.
