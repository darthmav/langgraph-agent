"""The corpus is built when someone asks for one, and not otherwise.

There used to be no distinction between opening a corpus and creating one:
`GraphRAGKnowledgeBase.__init__` makes the store on disk, and every read went
through it. So a corpus appeared as a side effect of asking whether there was
a corpus. `serve` started a preload thread at import, and the console polls
`rag_stats` every five seconds, which together meant that starting the server
was enough to leave a store behind -- one that then reported itself as a
knowledge base to everything that looked, having never been indexed.

What is pinned here is the split that fixes it: `open_knowledge_base` reads,
`get_knowledge_base` builds, and only an act of indexing goes through the
second one. Three acts qualify -- the Reindex button, a page the online
research phase keeps, and a run that finds nothing to search and indexes the
project before it starts -- and each is pinned to the creating door, to the
walk it must consult first, and to leaving no store behind when it turns out
to have nothing to put in one. The tests avoid the embedding model throughout,
which is also the claim of the last one in the file.
