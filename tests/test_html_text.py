"""Tests for the from-scratch HTML reader.

What is under test is the *judgement*, not the parsing: any parser can turn
tags into text, and the reason this module exists is that most of a page is not
the page. So the assertions are about what gets thrown away — a nav strip, a
footer, a script — and about the two ways that judgement can go wrong: keeping
chrome, and eating the article. The second is the dangerous one, because an
empty extraction is silent, so the fallback has its own test.
