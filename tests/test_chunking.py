"""Tests for splitting a document into passages the embedder can read whole.

Before chunking, `add_document` embedded a file in one `encode()` call while
the model's window is 256 tokens, so everything past roughly the first thousand
characters was silently discarded: measured on this project's own corpus, 73 of
77 documents truncated and 91.5% of the corpus unreachable by search, with the
vector for all 46,094 characters of CLAUDE.md identical to the vector for its
first 1,000. Nothing raised, and the counters read the same either way -- which
is why these are tests and not a note in the README.

No test here loads sentence-transformers. The suite goes out of its way to keep
the model out (`test_stats_does_not_load_the_embedder_for_the_health_check`
asserts as much), so the packing, the trimming and the collapse back onto
documents are all exercised against a stand-in tokenizer that reproduces the
one behaviour that matters: a slice re-tokenizes to a different length than it
had inside its parent.
