"""The cards: one model at a time, and every layer of it on the GPU.

Two claims, measured on 2026-09-20 on two 3 GB GTX 1060s and pinned here.

*Every layer.* Ollama's own estimator left ~1.1 GB unused on each card and ran
37% of a 9B Q4 seat on the CPU, whatever window it was asked for; forced with
`num_gpu`, the same model loaded 100% on the cards at the full 4,096-token
window. Seats were built with no options at all, so every local seat took the
estimate.

*One at a time.* qwen3-embedding is 4.7 GB and a 9B seat is 5.3 GB, against a
6 GB pool. The daemon's answer to being asked for both is a failed load, not a
split -- the journal caught one at 07:02:10, timing out after twenty seconds
spent trying to pack 48 layers onto card 1 because the embedder held card 0.
