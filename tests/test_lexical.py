"""Tests for the lexical half of search, and for the relevance floor it feeds.

Two defects are pinned here, and neither announced itself.

The first is that dense retrieval is a poor instrument for "this passage
contains this exact rare identifier". Measured against ground truth that cannot
be argued with -- 541 identifiers each defined in exactly one project file --
dense retrieval put the defining file first 53.4% of the time and dense plus a
BM25 re-rank 65.1%, McNemar p < 0.001, measured through `search` itself. Nothing about the failure is visible
from inside: search returned five plausible files, all real, all mentioning the
constant, and the one that *defines* it ranked fourth.

The second is the relevance floor. It was 0.3 once, hard-coded beside the
comparison in `nodes.py`, and 0.3 turned out to sit inside the off-corpus score
population rather than below it -- so a question this corpus cannot answer was
formatted into the findings as though it had. The floor is now measured per
corpus by `calibrate_relevance_floor` and stored beside the store, never
hard-coded: a cosine has no meaning across models, so no number is borrowed
from one model to judge another.

No test here talks to a daemon or loads a real embedder, for the reason
`test_chunking.py` does not: the ordering, the fusion and the invalidation are
all exercisable against a stand-in.
