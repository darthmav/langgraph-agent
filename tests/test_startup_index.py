"""The corpus is brought up to date when the console comes up, not only by a run.

Rebuilding it was a run's job alone, and a run is something the operator asks
for -- so between runs the header reported drift it had no way to fix, and
restarting the server did not clear it, because starting up only *opens* the
store. There is no Reindex button either: it was removed on the argument that a
run does this, which was right and left the case where a run is not what the
operator wants unattended.

Observed on 2026-09-18: a commit added `ollama_client.py` and put
`experimental/` into `PROJECT_INDEX_EXCLUDES`, the store was two days older
than both, and the header read `stale: 1 not indexed, 1 not in the walk` across
every restart -- correctly, permanently, and with nothing the operator could
press. What is pinned here is the phase that fixes it and the four things it
must not break: the creating door stays the only way a corpus comes into being,
the two phases never rebuild at once, a run always wins, and nothing may change
the corpus underneath either of them.

No test here loads the embedding model or indexes anything real; every one of
them stands in for `index_project_files`.
