"""Tests for keeping retrieval-only documents out of the graph's entities.

Two kinds: pages the research phase fetched, and markup, script and config
files (`ENTITY_FREE_SUFFIXES`). The web pages came first, and the reasoning is
theirs.

A page the research phase fetched is a *retrieval source*, not knowledge-graph
material, and `add_document`'s capital rule is far worse on web prose than on
this project's own files. `ENTITY_STOPWORDS` is a hand-audited list and it was
audited against source code and numpy docstrings, where the forced capitals are
`Returns`, `Every`, `False`. Web prose opens sentences with a different
vocabulary entirely and none of it is on the list.

Measured on 2026-09-09, after a few runs of the phase: 15 fetched pages had
minted **551 entities no project document mentions — 19% of the whole graph, at
36.7 per page** — `Although`, `Afterward`, `Altogether`, `Again`, `Accessed`.
Skipping them took the graph from 2,830 entities to 2,285 and duplicate
candidates from 205 to 171. Those edges are read as evidence by `neighborhood`,
`topics` and `duplicate_entities`, so the graph degraded as the corpus grew.

The decision is made from the document's **path**, never from the call site,
which is the load-bearing part: a reindex re-reads these files as ordinary
markdown, so a rule applied only where a page is first stored would be silently
reversed by the next rebuild.
