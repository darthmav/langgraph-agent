"""Tests for uploading a document into the corpus.

The claim under test is not "the bytes reached Chroma". It is that an uploaded
document is a document *of the corpus* — same id shape, same metadata, and
inside the walk a reindex rebuilds from — because the failure this path invites
is silent in both directions: a document embedded and then pruned by the next
rebuild, or a file the embedder cannot read filed under a real filename.

Built the way `test_corpus_admin.py` builds its knowledge base: field by field
around a fake collection, so the embedding model never loads. `add_document` is
the one method here that would embed, so the fake knowledge base stands in for
it and records what it was asked to store.
