"""Tests for the online research phase's place in a run.

The phase itself is tested in `test_web_research.py`. What is under test here
is *when* it happens and what a run does when it fails, because both are load
bearing and neither is visible from inside the phase.

The ordering is the whole design. `_refuse_while_a_run_is_in_flight` refuses
every other corpus write while a run is live, because a corpus changing
underneath the Researcher manufactures an absence no seat can detect: a rebuild
half-done returns whatever fraction of itself has been re-added, which reads as
`no_relevant_knowledge` and routes the run around a gap created out from under
it. Researching before the graph starts is not a way around that rule, it is
the only ordering that obeys it — so "research finished before the first
superstep" is the property, and it is asserted directly rather than assumed
from the order of the lines in the function.
