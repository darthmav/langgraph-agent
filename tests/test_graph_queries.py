"""Tests for traversing the knowledge graph.

The graph is a `DiGraph` whose every edge runs **document -> entity**, which
makes direction a trap rather than a detail: an entity has in-edges only, so a
directed walk starting from one reaches nothing at all. Both traversals here
have to take the undirected view, and the failure when they do not is silent —
`query_graph` returned the entity by itself for every entity in the corpus,
which reads as "this term connects to nothing" and not as a broken walk. It is
the Researcher's `query_knowledge_graph` tool, so for as long as it stood, one
half of retrieval answered every relationship question with silence.

Built field by field around a fake collection, the way `test_corpus_admin.py`
does, so the embedding model never loads.
