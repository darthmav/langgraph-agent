"""Ollama client for interacting with local Ollama models.

This script provides a simple interface to send prompts to the local Ollama API
and receive responses from the configured model.

Where the daemon is and how long to wait for it are read from
`langgraph_agent.config` rather than respelled here, so a daemon moved with
`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` -- the variable `.env.example` documents -- moves this script
with it. The raw client honours `OLLAMA_HOST` instead, which this project sets
nowhere, so a script left to that default keeps talking to 127.0.0.1 while every
seat follows the move.

# A cloud tag, because the cards belong to the embedder. Inference here is
# cloud-only, and `qwen3.8:latest` is 17 GB against 6 GB of VRAM: asking for it
# evicts `qwen3-embedding:latest`, which `OLLAMA_EMBED_OPTIONS` deliberately
# pins 100% onto those cards, and the next embed pays a full reload. A `:cloud`
# tag is proxied to ollama.com by the local daemon and needs `ollama signin`.
