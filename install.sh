#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One command from a fresh Arch / Omarchy machine to a console that runs.
#
# Safe to re-run. Every step looks before it acts, so a second run on a
# finished machine installs nothing, asks for no password, and ends by telling
# you whether each seat can actually run -- which is the only definition of
# "installed" that matters here.
#
# Everything it installs is free to use. System packages come from the Arch
# repos, Python packages from PyPI, the embedding model from the local Ollama
# daemon (its tokenizer from Hugging Face -- the chunker cuts passages with it
# in-process), the SearxNG and PostgreSQL images from Docker Hub, and inference
# from Ollama Cloud tags through that daemon, which a free ollama.com account
# can run. No seat needs an API key and nothing here asks for one: Anthropic
# and OpenAI stay optional, and unconfigured.
#
# The driver is the machine's own setup, not this script's -- Omarchy installs
# it. Nothing in this project touches torch or a card itself: the daemon owns
# the embedding model's placement, and OLLAMA_EMBED_OPTIONS in
# graphrag_server.py loads it with every layer on the cards. The one GPU
# decision made here is which Ollama build that daemon runs: a card too old for
# Arch's CUDA 13 build gets Ollama's own CUDA 12 build instead, through
# cuda-embed-ollama.sh (step 4). What this script then does is one real encode
# through the class a run uses, and says what the daemon reported back.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                everything below
#   ./install.sh --minimal      skip the optional developer tools
#   ./install.sh --no-system    skip pacman entirely (no sudo); Python side only
#   ./install.sh --no-cuda12    keep Arch's Ollama build on NVIDIA cards its
#                               CUDA 13 cannot drive (they embed on the CPU)
#   ./install.sh --no-searxng   do not run a SearxNG for online research
#   ./install.sh --no-postgres  do not run a PostgreSQL in Docker
#   ./install.sh --no-docker-group
#                               keep Docker behind sudo, Omarchy's default,
#                               rather than adding you to the docker group
#   ./install.sh --no-checks    skip ruff / mypy / pytest
#   ./install.sh --no-probe     do not send each seat a one-word test prompt
#   ./install.sh --no-desktop   do not add the console to the app launcher
#   ./install.sh --yes          never prompt (pacman --noconfirm, no sign-ins)
#
#   SEARXNG_PORT=8899 ./install.sh
#                               another loopback port for SearxNG when 8888 is
#                               taken (it is Jupyter's default); .env works too

step "Embedder"
# Pulling a model proves it is on the daemon, not that it embeds, and a run
# would find out only in its corpus phase. So the active model is asked for one
# vector through the class a run uses -- no corpus is opened or built -- and
# where the daemon placed it is read back: a split reply is identical to a whole
# one, and the split is what turns a first build of minutes into hours
# (OLLAMA_EMBED_OPTIONS in graphrag_server.py has the measurements). A model
# this check loaded is unloaded again, so the daemon is left holding what it
# held and the next run's GPU placement is not decided by an install.
