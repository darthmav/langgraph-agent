"""Find out which model actually works in which seat.

Two phases, deliberately separate, because they answer different questions and
one is far cheaper than the other.

**Phase 1 -- role probes.** One bounded call per (model, role) pair, through
the *real* role prompt and the *real* parser the node uses. It answers "can
this model hold this seat at all": did it answer, did the answer parse, and --
for the Builder -- can it call a tool. A model that fails its probe cannot be
rescued by a good team around it, and finding that out costs one call instead
of a whole run. This is the phase that would have caught the silent Researcher
in seconds.

**Phase 2 -- team runs.** Each configuration runs the same short exercise
through the same graph the console drives, instrumented per node. It answers
the question the probes cannot: whether four seats that each work alone make
progress *together*, or spend the run handing the same empty state back and
forth.

Both phases are read-mostly by design, with two exceptions worth knowing:

- Team runs let the Builder write files, so each one runs in its own sandbox
  directory under the scratchpad, never in the project. The Builder's tools
  resolve paths against the process cwd, so the sandbox is a `chdir`.
- The GraphRAG singleton resolves `./knowledge` on first use, so it is warmed
  from the project root *before* any sandbox exists. Every config then searches
  the real corpus, and no config gets an accidentally empty one.

Usage:

    python scripts/diagnose_seats.py --list
    python scripts/diagnose_seats.py --phase probe
    python scripts/diagnose_seats.py --phase teams --configs baseline,legacy
    python scripts/diagnose_seats.py --anthropic --exercise all

Nothing here is a benchmark. One short exercise per configuration is a
data point, not a ranking, and the report says so where it matters.
