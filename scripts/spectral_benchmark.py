"""Measure what spectral methods buy you, per graph architecture.

Usage:
    python scripts/spectral_benchmark.py                 # every suite
    python scripts/spectral_benchmark.py --suite recovery
    python scripts/spectral_benchmark.py --json out.json

The package's own reports establish that the algorithms are *correct* on a
handful of graphs. The open question is a different one -- on which shapes of
graph is a spectral method worth reaching for, and on which does something
cheaper do as well or better. That question is only answerable against a
baseline, so every claim here is a delta against a non-spectral competitor
from networkx: Kernighan-Lin for cuts, greedy modularity and label propagation
for communities, and a random partition as the floor.

The architectures are chosen to span the axis that theory says should matter --
whether the graph *has* a bottleneck at all -- and to include null controls
(expander, Erdos-Renyi) where the honest answer is "there is nothing to find".
A method that scores well on the planted partitions and also claims structure
in an expander has not earned the win.

Everything here uses numpy/scipy/networkx only, the same stack the package
restricts itself to. Deterministic: every generator and every k-means restart
is seeded.
