# It probes rather than waits. Neither dependency is fatal -- the console
# starts without Ollama and reports each seat's real state itself, and nothing
# in the app reads DATABASE_URL at all -- so a probe that blocked the start
# would turn a warning into an outage. What a probe must not do is stay quiet:
# a seat with no daemon behind it silently becomes StubLLM and completes a run
# on canned text, which is the one failure that looks like success.

# with no .env otherwise starts with every timeout at its code default rather
# than the values this project is actually run with.

# owns it there. When that is not the uid inside the container, git refuses the
# repository outright ("dubious ownership") and every git_ tool -- the whole of
# git_dwell -- fails on a repository that is perfectly fine.
#
# GIT_CONFIG_* rather than `git config --global`, because the usual way to give
# this container an identity is to mount the host's ~/.gitconfig read-only, and
# writing to that file is then impossible. These variables are supplementary:
# a mounted config still wins on the keys it sets.

# one. Without it `git_dwell`'s commit stage fails at the last moment, after
# branching and staging -- the half-finished sequence that tool exists to
# avoid. With the host's ~/.gitconfig mounted this is skipped and the commits
# carry the operator's own name.

# 3. the Ollama daemon -----------------------------------------------------
# Every default seat is an ollama seat and the one embedding model is served by
# the same daemon, so this is the dependency that decides whether the image can
# do anything at all. It lives on the host: under `network_mode: host` the
# default URL reaches it unchanged.

# 4. PostgreSQL ------------------------------------------------------------
# Nothing in the app reads DATABASE_URL -- the corpus is Chroma, under
# knowledge/ -- but the console exports .env to everything it runs, so this is
# the URL a script the Builder writes will use. That is exactly the kind of
# configuration nobody finds out is wrong until an agent is halfway through a
# task, so it is proved here the way install.sh proves it on the host: with a
# query, through psql.
