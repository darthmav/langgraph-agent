# The console as an Arch image.
#
# Arch rather than a python:* base because this project is an Arch/Omarchy
# project: `install.sh` names pacman packages, the interpreter it resolves
# against is Arch's current one (3.14), and the versions this repo is actually
# run on -- numpy 2.5, scipy 1.18, chromadb 1.5, transformers 5 -- are the ones
# that stack resolves to there. A Debian-based image would be a second,
# untested resolution of the same requirements.
#
# Three stages: `base` holds the system packages both halves need, `build`
# compiles the virtualenv (and only it needs base-devel, ~700 MB of toolchain),
# `runtime` takes the finished venv and none of the toolchain.

# The runtime half of install.sh's REQUIRED list. What is deliberately absent:
#   ollama      -- the daemon stays on the host. It owns the embedding model's
#                  placement on the GPU and holds the ollama.com credentials
#                  for the `:cloud` tags every default seat runs; this image
#                  only ever speaks HTTP to it (OLLAMA_BASE_URL).
#   xdg-utils   -- a container has no browser to open.
#   base-devel  -- build stage only.
# postgresql-libs is here for the reason install.sh puts it on the host: psql
# is how the database configuration is *proved* rather than assumed, and it is
# the client a script the Builder writes will reach for.

# Ollama daemon over HTTP. `kubernetes` is its client for a Chroma running as a
# server, and this one runs embedded, as files under knowledge/.
